- ISCAS_85/s_c5315: (Ongoing, impossible to use)
    - Error reason: Yosys Tool
    - Detail: 
        Yosys function "write_aiger -vmap" throws the "std::out_of_range" error
        The Yosys call is in the "partition" command when trying to transform the cleaned c5315.v into aig format.
    - Solution tried:
        - Update the Yosys source code and reinstall => didn't work

- ISCAS_85/s_c7552: (Ongoing, impossible to use)
    - Error reason: Yosys Tool
    - Detail: Same as c5315
    - Solution tried: Same as c5315

- ISCAS_85/s_c432: (Ongoing) => Fixed with the help of Tao 
    => The reason is the too old writing style of verilog from c432.v from U Michigan.
    - Error reason: Iverilog Tool
    - Detail: 
        Iverilog tool "iverilog -o " to generate the truth table seems wrong.
        The truth table generated is full of 'z'.
        It seems like the problem of not correctly used the benchmark file given.
        The Iverilog call is in the "evaluate_initial()" function when the "blasys" command is run.
    
- ISCAS_85/s_c6288: (Ongoing)
    - Error reason: Same as c432
